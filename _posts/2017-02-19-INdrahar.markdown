It is Sept 22, Swati’s Birthday and she took a not so popular, hard route trek to celebrate her Birthday.  The Route: Triund, Indrahar Pass, Hilling (Chamba Valley). Her friends Alka, Vikas, Bhupinder, Rahul, Aurabindo and Dhruv was joining us. At the stroke of midnight, Alka took her to the back of the bus and gave her a Blueberry cheese cake to cut. Yes, I know what you must be thinking, It was delicious, but let me not get distracted at the start of the post. Swati’s eyelids flew open as she saw a small cake under the light of a teeny tiny candle.

Birthday songs erupted inside the bus and the cake cut. With everyone tasting a piece of cake, Alka and Swati painted each other with the Blueberry topping. Nobody got away from Swati’s blueberry coated hands. We had to lick our hands and wipe the rest of the topping with tissues. Luckily the bus stopped at a petrol station. It gave us ample opportunity to clean ourselves up before sleep.

## Arriving at McLeod Ganj

We reached at Mcleodganj at 5.30. The jumpy bus conductor coerced us to deboard the bus within minutes. Hesitantly , we put on our bags and walked towards Dharamkot. Sun was just breaking loose of the mountain while taking the steep route via the mountaineering institute. Hotel reception was not open yet but I did get to know that most of the hotels were full of Israeli travelers. Swati pulled off her magic again and we found ourselves freshening up at Snow White Cafe. Dark clouds cast a marquee, distant thunders heard followed by rainfall. The weather promised us a fun trek.

Grabbing a lunch at Milky way Cafe, we hired two taxi to take us to Galu temple (trail head). The rain had loosened the rocks and made the road slippery. We had to get down from the car couple of time to make it easy for the engine to haul it over steep areas. We did not spend time at the temple and we started on the route after logging our entry at the Forest Checkpost.
